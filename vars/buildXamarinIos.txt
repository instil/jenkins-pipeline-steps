Build step for interacting with `msbuild` to build Xamarin iOS projects and sign using the default signing identities produced by Fastlane and stored in the `fastlane` keychain.

* (Optional) `solution` - the path to the solution to be built. If omited, this will attempt to find a `.sln` file on disk and the step will fail if nothing is supplied / found.
* (Optional) `configuration` - the Xamarin build configuration to use, or 'Release' by default.
* (Optional) `platform` - the platform to build for, or 'iPhone by default'.
* (Optional) `buildIpa` - a boolean indicating whether or not to build the `.ipa` file – 'true' by default.
* (Optional) `archive` - a boolean indicating whether or not to archive the build – 'true' by default.
